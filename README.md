# Hacker_news_posts
In this project we are going to specifically interested in posts with titles that begin with either Ask Hackr News or Show Hacker News. Users submitted Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.Likewise, users submitted Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product or anything mildly interesting.In this project we sill compare these two types of posts to determine the following:
- Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` receive more comments on average?
- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
